		<p><strong>Isis:</strong> Isis was born in the Asyrun Barrens to wealthy landowners. She enrolled in a military mission to the lands surrounding the Underworld gate as a priestess, using her medical expertise to heal the wounded soldiers fighting the hellspawn. After watching the slaughter of entire families at the hands of the hellspawn, she signed up to become an Asyrun Ravager, a female berserker guardian of the Asyrun Queen. She has since left the Ravagers and become a bounty hunter who gets her orders directly from the Queen. Since the Human Crown has long competed for rule over all humans with the Asyruns, Isis has executed several high ranking Crown officials and is the seventeenth most wanted in the Crown. She is well known for her challenging her targets in public to duel, which they cannot refuse in order to maintain their honour.
	She often uses bands of raiders as information gatherers; one such band, led by those inspired by Isis' rebellious work, called the Band of the White Star, often follows her across Arzodium on her missions, often arriving before her as a harbinger of her arrival. When the White Star arrives, the rich and noble leave town, but those chosen to be executed never get far, slain by either Isis herself or the Band.</p>

		<p><strong>Ve'lkrath:</strong> Created over two-hundred years ago, Ve'lkrath is a rare ice-type medium-build male  hellspawn, maturing into a sentinel by his 85th year. Entering the ranks of the Nightstalker Brigade during his 97th year, he participated in numerous conflicts where he undertook thousands of various missions, accumulating an incredible kill-count of around ten-thousand and creating a wide swath of destruction in Eastern Arzodium. By his 170th year he had become a team leader, leading rookie nightstalkers on their first missions. Around his 190th year, his mind ascended to gain a conscience and morals. While most hellspawn are executed when this happens to maintain order, Ve'lkrath was spared because he showed no external signs of this affecting him. However, the decade that passed after ascension weighed heavily on his mind, his newly acquired conscience heavily burdened by the atrocities he had committed.  
	During his 202nd year, Ve'lkrath refused to execute a pair of human children, and killed two rookie nightstalkers when they tried to finish the job. He then brought the two children to safer areas away from Eastern Arzodium, taking one to the Asyrun barrens and the other to Wynterwyld. Ve'lkrath was subsequently branded a traitor by the Underworld. Leaving to the Upper-world, he stumbled upon a small cabin in the Wynterwyld forest, eventually befriending the old hunter who lived there. He discovered that the two children he had saved were related by blood to the man, and the two stayed in contact for two years before the hunter died of old age.
Burying the body in a nearby clearing and marking the grave with a large white stone, Ve'lkrath moved into the now empty cabin, keeping it in decent form. Despite his prolonged absence, Eastern Arzodium still has a massive bounty on his head, and there are hundreds of bounty hunters at any given time travelling across Arzodium hoping to find their quarry. As of now, he has lived in the cabin for twenty years, making him possibly the oldest hellspawn in existence.</p>

		<p><strong>Tanveria:</strong> Tanveria showed signs of the gift from a young age, and was taken from her family in the deserts of Eastern Arzodium. Trained relentlessly to be an agent of the imperial inquisition, Tanveria arose to the position of Lady Inquisitor - equivalent to the rank of lieutenant - and served a brief term as commander of the Evenweld Pact's northern forces before moving on to other, more secretive assignments across Arzodium.</p>

		<p><strong>Elfhiem:</strong> Born to a high-ranking elven huntress and a human wizard, Elfhiem discovered his ability to project fire and lightning at a young age. His father, an extremely skilled and powerful arcane caster himself, helped him improve on both control and power. Unfortunately, his mother's family believed that his father was tainting their family's bloodline, and conspired to murder him. 
	Poisoning his father's tea one night, the elves proceeded to stab him multiple times, though two of their number were struck down with arcane blasts. The rest escaped into the night after retrieving their dead family members. 
	Unexpectedly for the elven family, Elfhiem's father was close friends with a number of high-ranking human officials, and there was public outcry in the Human Crown for the arrest and execution of the murderers. Public opinion pressured the elven crown to take action. After a thorough investigation, his mother's family was implicated in the crime and executed, with the exception of one member - his uncle, who escaped into the forest. His mother herself left him, blaming him for her family's execution. 
	Elfhiem lived in an orphanage until he was twelve years old, when he was discovered by a kind-hearted elven noble who adopted and raised him. Ever since then, Elfhiem has trained in both magic and the elven hunting arts, waiting for the day when he could kill his uncle and avenge his father.</p>
