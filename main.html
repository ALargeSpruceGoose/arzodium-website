		<p>Welcome to the Arzodium supercontinent!</p>
		<p>To avoid being eaten by various dangerous ocean creatures, please travel on designated waters only.</p>
		<p>Arzodium is a medieval-fantasy animation/novelisation project being undertaken by five high-school students. The first animation will come out during early febuary, and subsequent episodes will come at two-month intervals. The title is derived from the continent that these events take place in.
